# GPIO to UART 
This code example is more of an experiment and should not be used unless first modified. This code does NOT work.

The purpose of this exploration was to to emulate a simplified version of the UART protocol using GPIO pins. The task proved to be trickier than it seemed, and we were unable to get it working reliably.
